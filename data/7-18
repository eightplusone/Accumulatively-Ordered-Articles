The international soccer transfer market is like NBA free agency â€” except crazier and less reliable. And the latest focus of transfer rumors has been Barcelona star Neymar.

He doesnâ€™t look to be letting the rumors get to him, though.

On the same day that Brazilian outlet Esporte Interactivo reported that Neymar was close to agreeing on a $257 million transfer fee to leave Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain, the Brazilian soccer star was busy partying in Ibiza with Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green.

If a record transfer deal to PSG was on Neymarâ€™s mind, we wouldnâ€™t know of it from the Instagram story. Neymar and Green are clearly enjoying themselves.

Green has spent the past couple days in Spain with Neymar.

They met in person for the first time after Game 2 of the NBA Finals, and Green was particularly pumped to meet Neymar. That seemed to be the start of a very EDM-heavy friendship.
