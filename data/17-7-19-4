Las Palmas midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng has expressed his delight at the possibility of Neymar joining PSG, just so he can play as the Ligue 1 giants in next season's FIFA video game.
Goal reported on Tuesday that the Barcelona star is ready to leave Camp Nou for PSG, meaning he would link up with Edinson Cavani and Julian Draxler in the French capital.
What are the odds on Barca winning La Liga?

Former Tottenham and Milan midfielder Boateng would love to see the transfer materialise - but mainly due to the fact that he will then play as the French club in FIFA 18!
The Ghanaian shared his hopes on Twitter, writing "If Neymar will join PSG, you know what my team will be on FIFA18".
If @neymarjr will join @PSG_inside,you know what my team will be on FIFA18 #justsayin â€” Kevin-Prince Boateng (@KPBofficial) July 18, 2017
Neymar would become PSG's highest-rated player in the game, and was the third highest rated player overall in FIFA 17 after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.
No PSG player made the top 10 highest ratings in last year's edition, with 89-rated defender Thiago Silva coming out on top of all Unai Emery's squad.
