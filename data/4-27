Neymar has been told to quit Barcelona in favour of a move to the Premier League.
Neymar has scored 104 goals in 184 appearances with Barcelona who signed him from Santos in 2013.

Mourinho is also believed to be lining up a move for Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic, who he re-signed from Benfica for £22m in 2014 during his second spell as boss at Stamford Bridge.

The Serbian played a big part in the Blues' Premier League triumph as he formed a strong duo with N'Golo Kante in midfield.

Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann is another marquee player Mourinho is considering bringing to Old Trafford.

Express Sport understands he has made him his No 1 transfer target with the Portuguese boss keen on activating his £86m release clause in a bid to get a deal over the line. 

But with Neymar's future at the Nou Camp being cast into doubt, Mourinho could now put all of his efforts into signing the Brazilian superstar as he bids to get United back on top in the Premier League and Europe. 

However, Pep Guardiola could beat United to Neymar's signature with the Barca striker admitting last year that he would love to play under the Spaniard. 

"Guardiola is a guy that I really admire and who I would love to work with," said Neymar.
