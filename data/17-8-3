BAYERN Munich were presented with Neymar in 2010, but turned the Brazilian down because of his €24m fee.

That's according to Croatian football agent, Predrag Racki, who, along with Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni, reportedly met Bayern's then-sporting director Christian Nerlinger in 2010 to convince him of the player's worth.

"I met Nerlinger in Munich after talking to him twice over the phone," he said in an interview with Novilist.

"He told me they were aware of who Neymar was, one of biggest talents in the world.

"He also said, however, that they would keep following him, but Bayern wasn't willing to give that much money for a player who wasn't 18 yet."

He explained: "It was the January transfer window in 2010 when Danny Budimir from Golden Goal Sports & Marketing agency in Chicago made contact with Neymar's agent Wagner Ribeiro.

"And at the same time, with help of my friend Giovanni Trapattoni, I arranged a meeting with Bayern's director for football Christian Nerlinger.

"At the time Neymar was 17 and you could tell he was top class, great technique, great skills ... he was only far thinner than he is today..."


Barcelona's famous move came three years later, with the Santos graduate going on to be sold for Paris Saint-Germain last week for a cool €198m more than Bayern felt was too expensive.
