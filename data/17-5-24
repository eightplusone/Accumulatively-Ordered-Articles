Neymar exit to spark Barcelona spree: Manchester United and Arsenal could be affected
BARCELONA will reportedly look to make three high-profile signings if Neymar leaves the club this summer.

	
	
Neymar, 25, has been the subject of increased transfer speculation in recent months.

Don Balon claim the Brazil international could well leave Catalonia this summer amid interest from both Manchester clubs and French giants Paris St-Germain.

And Barcelona will reportedly use the cash from a sale to build a team capable of challenging Real Madrid next term.

They finished three points behind their fierce rivals in the Spanish top flight this season, while Zinedine Zidane's men also have a Champions League final to look forward to.

The Nou Camp hierarchy apparently have three key targets in mind: Atletico Madrid star Antoine Griezmann, Arsenal's Hector Bellerin and Marco Verratti of Paris St-Germain.

News of Barca's interest in Griezmann could come as a blow to Manchester United.

The Red Devils have been heavily linked with the striker, who himself talked up a move to Old Trafford on French TV this week.

Bellerin meanwhile, began his career with Barcelona before joining the Gunners in 2011.

He has since nailed down a place in Arsene Wenger's first-team, making 33 Premier League appearances this term.

Verratti endured a frustrating season in France as PSG conceded their title to Monaco.

The midfielder still has four years left to run on his contract at the Parc des Princes after he penned a new long-term deal last summer.
