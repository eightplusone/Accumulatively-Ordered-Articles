The Brazilian has seen terms in his contract activated, with those at Camp Nou eager to fend off any admiring glances being shot in their direction
Neymar’s release clause at Barcelona has been increased to €222 million (£192.5m).
The cost of buying the Brazilian out of his contract has been automatically raised as part of his current deal at Camp Nou.
When putting pen to paper in October 2016, Barca inserted a €200m buy-out clause in Neymar’s terms.

It was stipulated that regular rises would be made to help keep the forward in Catalonia.
One of those has now kicked in, with Barca understandably reluctant to part with a prized asset.
They have seen Neymar linked with the likes of Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain in the recent past, with the 25-year-old now one of the world’s top talents.

Barca will, however, continue to fend off any interest being shown.
Having sought to price Neymar out of the current market, his release clause will be nudged up again to €250m in 2018.
That will draw him level with Lionel Messi and the terms he agreed back in 2014.

The Argentine is, however, currently locked in discussions regarding fresh terms, with Goal revealing that a lucrative contract is set to be signed once Messi returns to Europe after his summer wedding.
Barca will be hoping that both he and Neymar continue to shine for many years to come.
The latter passed 100 goals for the club during the 2016-17 campaign, with the target having now been found 105 times in just 186 appearances.
