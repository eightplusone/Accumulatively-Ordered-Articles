Neymar would reportedly like to see one of his countrymen at FC Barcelona, but superstar Lionel Messi has apparently told the Brazilian to forget about the potential deal.

The 25-year-old has been linked with a world record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain, who are reportedly keen to activate his €222 million (R3.3 billion) buyout clause.

However, Blaugrana defender Gerard Pique appears to have ended the Neymar speculation after posting a picture with the Brazilian, along with the captain "he stays", on Instagram and Twitter on Sunday.

One of the reasons Neymar is reportedly seriously considering leaving the Camp Nou is said to be the lack of his countrymen in the dressing room, particularly after Dani Alves left the club in 2016.

As a consequence, Neymar apparently urged the Barca board to sign his Selecao teammate Paulinho. However, his Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande want €40 million (R602 million) for the former Tottenham Hotspur player.

In addition, Messi and other senior figures in the dressing room are not in favour of the transfer, according to Don Balon. The report claimed that the Argentine told Neymar to forget about seeing Paulinho move to the Camp Nou.


So far, the Spanish giants have only signed right back Nelson Semedo in this window, and also activated Gerard Deulofeu's buyback clause to sign him from Everton.
