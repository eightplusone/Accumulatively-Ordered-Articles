Neymar is not expected to fly back to Barcelona with the squad following Saturday's Clasico matchup against Real Madrid in Miami, a source has told ESPN's Jordi Blanco.

According to the source, the Brazil international will head to China to satisfy promotional obligations for Barcelona and Nike directly following the conclusion of the Blaugrana's International Champions Cup tour of the United States.

And the source added that Neymar could join Paris Saint-Germain's training camp after his trip to China, however the 25-year-old forward is not expected to make an announcement about his future until after the events in China.

Neymar has been the subject of a drawn out transfer saga over the past week-and-a-half, with PSG reportedly set to trigger his €222 million release clause and sign the former Santos star to a mega-deal.

Sources told ESPN FC on Saturday that Neymar and his father, Neymar Sr., who has been in discussions with PSG's Qatari owners and sporting director Antero Henrique, have agreed to a massive contract that would see Neymar earn about €30m a year after taxes and would also be given a signing bonus in excess of his net annual sum.

In addition to those earnings and bonuses, the source stated that Neymar and his father would also profit from a number of club owners Oryx Qatar Sports Investments' other commercial ventures in Paris and away from the world of football.

L'Equipe reported on Thursday an agreement has been reached between PSG and the Brazil international. However, an accord between the Parisian club and Barcelona has still yet to be struck at this point.
